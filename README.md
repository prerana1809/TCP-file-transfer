â€“ File transfer using Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
File transfer with TCP involves transferring a file from one device to another over a network connection using TCP as the underlying protocol.

It is a reliable method of transferring files over a network. TCP is a connection-oriented 
protocol that provides reliable, error-free data transfer between two endpoints. During file 
transfer, TCP establishes a connection between the client and the server, and then transmits 
the data in packets(three-way handshaking). It ensures that all packets are delivered in the 
correct order and that any lost or corrupted packets are retransmitted. TCP also provides 
congestion and flow control, preventing the network from becoming overloaded. 

Overall, file transfer with TCP is a secure, efficient, and reliable way to transfer 
files over a network.
